### 📢News
🔥 **[……]**:

🔥 **[2024]**: Remote sensing multimodal large language model is an ongoing project. We will be working on improving it.

🔥 **[2024/1]**: **SkyEyeGPT** now is available at arXiv. 
- This work explores the **remote sensing multimodal large language model (vision-language)**. We meticulously curate a high-quality remote sensing multi-modal instruction tuning dataset, including single-task and multi-task conversation instructions, namely **SkyEye-968k**. We develop **SkyEyeGPT**, which unifies remote sensing vision-language tasks and breaks new ground in enabling the unified modeling of remote sensing vision and LLM.  Experiments on 8 datasets for remote sensing vision language tasks demonstrate SkyEyeGPT’s superiority in image-level and region-level tasks. Specially, it has shown encouraging results in some tests, compared with GPT-4V. 

🔥 **[2024/1]**: A curated list about [Remote Sensing Multimodal Large Language Model (Vision-Language)](https://github.com/ZhanYang-nwpu/Awesome-Remote-Sensing-Multimodal-Large-Language-Model) is created.

🔥 **[2023/12]**: Propose the **Mono3DVG** task and construct the **Mono3DRefer** dataset（accepted by **AAAI2024**）!
- For intelligent systems and robots, understanding objects based on language expressions in real 3D scenes is an important capability for human-machine interaction. However, existing 2D visual grounding cannot capture the true 3D extent of the referred objects. 3D visual grounding requires laser radars or RGB-D sensors, which greatly limits its application scenarios due to the expensive cost and device limitations. Monocular 3D object detection is low-cost and has strong applicability, but it cannot localize specific objects. We introduce a novel task of **3D visual grounding in monocular RGB images** using language descriptions with appearance and geometry information. We create **Mono3DRefer**, which is the first dataset that leverages the ChatGPT to generate descriptions. We believe Mono3DVG can be widely applied since it does not require strict conditions such as RGB-D sensors, LiDARs, or industrial cameras. The application scenarios are wide, such as drones, surveillance systems, intelligent vehicles, robots, and other devices equipped with cameras.

🔥 **[2023/08]**: Propose a novel **PE-RSITR** task and provide empirical studies（accepted by **T-GRS**）!
- This work explores the **parameter-efficient transfer learning** for remote sensing image-text retrieval. Our proposed **MRS-Adapter** reduces **98.9\%** of fine-tuned parameters and its performance exceeds traditional methods by **7\%**~**13\%**.
  
🔥 **[2023/02]**: Propose the **RSVG** task and construct the **DIOR-RSVG** dataset（accepted by **T-GRS**）!
- This work explores the **visual grounding** for remote sensing domain. The **DIOR-RSVG** takes DIOR dataset as the data source and is built using an automatic generation algorithm with manual verification. A novel transformer-based **MGVLF** model is devised to solve problems of the cluttered background and scale variation of RS images.
  
🔥 **[2022/08]**: Propose a **STMGCN** for vessel traffic flow prediction（accepted by **T-ITS**）!
- This work explores **multi-graph convolutional network** for vessel traffic flow prediction. Due to the difference between water traffic and land traffic, we propose a **big data-driven maritime traffic network extraction algorithm** to construct a "road network". We then design a **STMGCN** to make full use of maritime graphs and multi-graph learning (including distance graph, interaction graph, and correlation graph).

🔥 **[2021/08]**: Propose a **MVFFNet** for imbalanced ship classification（accepted by **PRLetters**）!
