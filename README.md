- [2023/12]: Propose the **Mono3DVG** task and construct the **Mono3DRefer** dataset（accepted by **AAAI2024**）!
For intelligent systems and robots, understanding objects based on language expressions in real 3D scenes is an important capability for human-machine interaction. However, existing 2D visual grounding cannot capture the true 3D extent of the referred objects. 3D visual grounding requires laser radars or RGB-D sensors, which greatly limits its application scenarios due to the expensive cost and device limitations. Monocular 3D object detection is low-cost and has strong applicability, but it cannot localize specific objects. We introduce a novel task of 3D visual grounding in monocular RGB images using language descriptions with appearance and geometry information. We create Mono3DRefer, which is the first dataset that leverages the ChatGPT to generate descriptions. We believe Mono3DVG can be widely applied since it does not require strict conditions such as RGB-D sensors, LiDARs, or industrial cameras. The application scenarios are wide, such as drones, surveillance systems, intelligent vehicles, robots, and other devices equipped with cameras.
- [2023/08]: Propose a novel **PE-RSITR** task and provide empirical studies（accepted by **TGRS**）! This work explores the **parameter-efficient transfer learning** for remote sensing image-text retrieval. Our proposed **MRS-Adapter** reduces **98.9\%** of fine-tuned parameters and its performance exceeds traditional methods by **7\%**~**13\%**.
